- f1_score Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 This dataset contains the muliple classes. In this project we are just giving you how to deal with the multiple classes. We are not using all the features here. You will suprise after seen the result. We encourage you to download the dataset and play around it as you have come across far in your Data Science Learning.
